# MP3Player
One of my first GUI (graphical user interface) programs I coded with a lot of assistance with my high school computer science teacher. In the end, it works to a certain extent, but considering I wasn't even legal to drive at the time, you can cut me some slack on this one.

## How to run code
For this code to work, drag and drop the .java files into any java programming compiler, the code for us was written on a software called Eclipse. There are two 
files, and you have to make sure that both of them are open at once. The "MP3.java" file is where 90% of the code is writeen (roughly) and provides the basis
for the second program "MP3Player.java", where you can actually play the songs. There's also one more file attached, called the "reserve" folder. Here is where 
you can drag and drop your own .mp3 files so that they can be heard on-screen. After all this is done, get ready to jam to your music!
